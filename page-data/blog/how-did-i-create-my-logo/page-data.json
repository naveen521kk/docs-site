I am no artist and new to Inkscape UI; I was going to each of the tools avaiable there. Something which intersted me was <strong>Pen Tools</strong>, which would be able to draw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve\">Beizer Curve</a>. I was playing with that and then that gave me an idea ðŸ’¡.</p>\n<p>I decided that my logo is going to contain a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve#Quadratic_B%C3%A9zier_curves\">Quadratic Beizer Curve</a> with the starting point as <code>(0, 0)</code>; second control point <code>(0.5, 1)</code>; and the end point as <code>(1, 0)</code>. Similaryly there would be a curve around all the other sides. I tried to do that Inkscape and I didn't get any sucess ðŸ˜¢.</p>\n<p>Annoyed with Inkscape, I though it would be better to create things programmically. I wanted some tool which could give me an SVG and a API which is easy to understand. I have previously used <a href=\"https://pycairo.readthedocs.io\">PyCairo(Python Bindings for Cairo Graphics Library)</a> for <a href=\"https://manim.community\">Manim</a> and understand it's API a bit; I decided to use it.</p>\n<p>I started to write a script which will create me the SVG. So, I started with creating a <a href=\"https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/surfaces.html\"><code>cairo.Surface</code></a> and a <a href=\"https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/context.html\"><code>cairo.Context</code></a> from that. I decided to get a 500x500 SVG file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">import cairo\r\n\r\nwidth, height = 500, 500\r\nwith cairo.SVGSurface(\"logo.svg\", width, height) as surface:\r\n    context = cairo.Context(surface)\r\n    context.scale(width, height)\r\n    context.set_line_width(0.01)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have scaled the <code>context</code> so I can use units within <code>(0,1)</code> rather than absolute size. Also, I have set the line width to <code>0.01</code> (a random value from <em>trial and error</em>).</p>\n<p>Now, to draw a beizer curve as I previously mentioned, I had to use <a href=\"https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/context.html#cairo.Context.curve_to\"><code>Context.curve_to</code></a> method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">context.curve_to(0, 0, 0.5, 1, 1, 0) # (0, 0), (0.5, 1), (1, 0)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I set the color I wanted, for now I just choose Black(<code>#000000</code>).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">context.set_source_rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then finally use <a href=\"https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/context.html#cairo.Context.stroke\"><code>Context.stroke</code></a> to draw the curve on to surface.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">context.stroke()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This whole code now becomes</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-py\">import cairo\r\n\r\nwidth, height = 500, 500\r\nwith cairo.SVGSurface(\"logo.svg\", width, height) as surface:\r\n    context = cairo.Context(surface)\r\n    context.scale(width, height)\r\n    context.set_line_width(0.01)\r\n    context.curve_to(0, 0, 0.5, 1, 1, 0) # (0, 0), (0.5, 1), (1, 0)\r\n    context.set_source_rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)\r\n    context.stroke()\n</code></pre>\n<p>which gave me an SVG like</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/logo-post/beizer-curve.svg\" alt=\"beizer curve cairo\"></p>\n<p>TBD.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 10, 2021","slug":"/blog/how-did-i-create-my-logo","title":"How did I create my Logo?","description":"I created my Logo using beizer curves and PyCairo.","image":"/images/banner.png"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c6a77f1-df63-5f79-bc75-4e86acc4f053","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/how-did-i-create-my-logo","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1216879795"]}
